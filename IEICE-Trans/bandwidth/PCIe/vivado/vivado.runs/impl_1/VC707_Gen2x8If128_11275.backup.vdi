Phase 1.1.2 IO and Clk Clean Up
WARNING: [Place 30-575] Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	dramcon/u_dram/u_dram_mig/u_ddr3_clk_ibuf/diff_input_clk.u_ibufg_sys_clk (IBUFDS.O) is locked to IOB_X1Y276
	dramcon/u_dram/u_dram_mig/u_iodelay_ctrl/clk_ref_mmcm_gen.mmcm_i (MMCME2_ADV.CLKIN1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on MMCME2_ADV_X0Y6
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.

INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 8 threads
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLCK-23) Clock Placer Checks - Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.
